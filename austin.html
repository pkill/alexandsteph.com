	<h2>Our favorite things to do in Austin</h2>
	<p>We've made Austin our home because it's an amazing city. The people, the culture, and the food are what make it. Even though we love to travel, seeing the world always proves to show what Austin does right. If only it wasn't so hot!</p>
	<p>During your stay be sure to take in some of what makes Austin.</p>
