title: To Do in Austin
---
	<h2>Our favorite things to do in Austin</h2>
	<p>We've made Austin our home because it's an amazing city. The people, the culture, and the food are a big part of what make it so great. Even though we love to travel, seeing the world always proves to show what Austin does right. If only it wasn't so hot!</p>
	<p>During your stay be sure to take in some of what makes Austin.</p>

	<h3>Do</h3>
	<h4><a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool" alt="Barton Springs" target="_blank">Barton Springs</a></h4>
	<p>September is the last month to cool off in Austin's spring fed pool.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://pecanstreetfestival.org/" target="_blank">Pecan Street Festival</a></h4>
	<p>This arts, crafts and music festival will be happening blocks from the wedding venue.</p>


	<h4><a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/ann-and-roy-butler-hike-and-bike-trail" target="_blank">Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail</a></h4>
	<p>The hike and bike trail surrounds Lady Bird Lake from Mopac to Pleasant Valley. Alex and Steph both love to hit the trail for a run, when it's not too hot.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://www.austintexas.org/listings/south-congress-avenue-(soco)/4359/" target="_blank">South Congress</a></h4>
	<p>Stroll and window-shop down this street with weird shops, food trucks, and live music.</p>

	<h4>Catch a concert at <a href="https://mohawkaustin.com/" target="_blank">Mohawk</a>, <a href="https://www.stubbsaustin.com/concert-listings" target="_blank">Stubb's</a> or <a href="http://acl-live.com/" target="_blank">Austin City Limits</a></h4>
	<p>Austin loves live music. While you can find it walking around 6th street, these three music venues are our favorite places to catch a show. </p>

	<h4><a href="https://drafthouse.com/austin" target="_blank">Alamo Drafthouse Movie Theater</a></h4>
	<p>Get dinner and a movie together at the same time. Alamo serves dinner and drinks while you watch the latest releases or attend themed viewings of old favorites.</p>

	<h4><a href="https://blantonmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Blanton Museum of Art</a></h4>
	<p>Austin's primary art collection and surrounding grounds are well worth a visit.</p>
