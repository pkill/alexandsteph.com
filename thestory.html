					<h4>Together since Dec 2009</h4>
				</header>
				<p>It wouldn’t be a true college love story if it didn’t start in a bar. </p>
				<header>
					<h5>Introduction</h5>
						</header>
					<p>It was the fall semester of 2008. Alex and Steph were meeting friends at Chumley’s, a bar they both frequented at Purdue. A dear mutual friend of theirs was in attendance and introduced Alex to Steph. With a handshake and feisty banter between them they left indelible impressions on one another. Steph recalls telling her friend as they left, "Something about that guy, Alex!" </p>
					<p>Something indeed! Over a year of casual friendship ensued. Steph would invite Alex to communal veggie dinners. These veggie dinners were attended by wonderful people and featured great conversation and delicious potluck fare. As their mutual friend group got closer, they found ways to spend quality time together, too. Alex would bring episodes of House over to Steph’s. Their friendship easily deepened and in Dec 2009, they decided to go on a date and never looked back. It was effortless. </p>
					<h5>Moving to Texas</h5>
					<p>While Alex and Steph were hardy midwest natives, the winter of 2011 proved to be brutal. When Alex was offered an internship in Austin they jumped at the chance. Steph was happy to escape the freezing weather! In the summer of 2011, they moved into a small apartment on South 1st Street and kick-started their careers. Meeting some amazing new friends in Austin made the decision to become Texans easy, so they bought a house in 2017.</p>
			<h5>The Proposal</h5>
			<p>In February 2017 Alex had to fly to Japan for work. He was abroad for three weeks and it had been the longest they had been apart in years. What Steph didn’t know was that before leaving Alex had devised a plan that he would execute upon his return. That night, despite being weary from a lot of travelling, Alex popped the question in their backyard adult-sized treehouse. The ring was hidden in an antique Japanese jewelry box that Alex had brought back as a gift. Steph opened one of the tiny drawers and revealed a stunning surprise. It was in that moment that Alex asked Steph if she wanted to spend their lives together forever. Obviously she said yes!</p>
